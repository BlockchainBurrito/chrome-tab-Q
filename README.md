#Tabs limiter with queue#

**Tabs limiter with queue** allows you to limit the number of tabs opened in a Chrome window. New tabs exceeding the limit will be put in a queue, when a tab is closed and there's enough space in the active window, the next URL from the queue loads automatically in a new background tab.

The main purpose of this extension is to keep the browser free from a ton of background tabs that are consuming memory and CPU cycles (and battery life on laptops). It's perfect for opening links like a maniac on  Reddit, Google searches or photos/wallpaper sites.

By default tabs with URL matching Chrome internal pages won't be counted in the limit. For example chrome://extension or chrome://settings can be opened any time. This also means that you can open a new tab manually and then load any page from there, that tab won't be queued.

IMPORTANT: This extension is not meant to be used as some kind of "read later" or session manager. It's a simple tab limiter with some extra functionality.
